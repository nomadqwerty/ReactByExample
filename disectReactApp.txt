-react app is made to display html to the user. 
-react can also change html based of events the user may signal
-events  like onclick on submit onscroll etc 

-we tell react what to show by writing f(n)s that return jsx

import './styles.css'

import React, { useState } from "react";
import Field from "./components/field";
import Translate from "./components/translate";
import Languages from "./components/languages";

/////////
-we tell react what to show by writing f(n)s that return jsx
-react reads the returned jsx and knows it should create html with the given elements
-jsx looks like html. it is responsible for telling react to display certain elements or display whole react comp functs
-f(n)s that return jsx are called react components
-react components are responsible for displaying content for certain parts of the app  
//////

export default function App() {
  const [language, setLanguage] = useState('es')
  const [text, setText] = useState('')

//

  return (
    <div>
      <Field onChange={setText}/>
      <Languages language={language} onLanguageChange={setLanguage} />
      <hr />
      <Translate text={text} language={language} />
