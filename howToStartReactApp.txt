a bunch of js files that will be bundle by a bundler
once bundled the files are place on server where user can access the file
when are app ip is req by user. our server responseds with a html file.
note that all react files always have a html file attached to it

html files dont do much other than tell the browser to req some more js files from our server
once done our server sends the bundled js files

//how react is displayed

// hook onto an element in the dom
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
// tell react we would like to take control of that element
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

// tell react to convert jsx to html and display it in the tartget ellement
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <div className="wrapper">
      <App />
    </div>
  </StrictMode>
);


/////useState()
useState is a function that works with the react state system
works like variables storing data that will change over time
when ever state in changes reacts auto updates data displayed
